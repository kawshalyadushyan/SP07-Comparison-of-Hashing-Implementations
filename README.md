## Short Project SP07: Comparison of Hashing Implementations
* Comparison of one or more Hashing Algorithms from - Double Hashing, Robin Hood Hashing, Hopscotch Hashing, Cuckoo Hashing with Java's inbuilt HashMap/ HastSet over millions of add(), contains() and remove() operations. 
* Finding distinct elements from a large array of randomly generated integers using the above Hashing Implementation(s).

### Problems:

#### A. Team Task: 

**Problem 1.**
a. Implement one or more hashing algorithms from the following:
	Double hashing / Robin Hood / Hopscotch / Cuckoo
   Compare its/their performance with Java's HashMap/HashSet on millions of
   operations: add, contains, and remove.

**Solution:** 
[Double Hashing](https://github.com/rahul1947/SP07-Comparison-of-Hashing-Algorithms/blob/master/DoubleHashing.java) 
[Robin Hood Hashing](https://github.com/rahul1947/SP07-Comparison-of-Hashing-Algorithms/blob/master/RobinHood.java) 
[Cuckoo Hashing](https://github.com/rahul1947/SP07-Comparison-of-Hashing-Algorithms/blob/master/Cuckoo.java)

b. Generate an array of random integers, and calculate how many distinct
   numbers it has:  static<T> int distinctElements(T[ ] arr) { ... }
   Compare running times of HashSet and your hashing implementation, for large n.
